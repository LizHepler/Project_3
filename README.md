EMS Calls for Opioid Emergencies

This project shows the graphical visualization of emergency calls made for opioids in the city of Tempe, AZ.

The data collected for this project is  from the website, https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/opioid-ems-calls-ac2fc.  This has the data from 2017 to 2024.

The data collected has been reviewed and no personal or identification data is extracted.

We have used Xpert learning Assistant to get code for grouping the data by month and age.  
We used the CanvasJS library to plot Bar Chart, and used the template for the code.
